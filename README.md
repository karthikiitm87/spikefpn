This work explores the membrane potential dynamics of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and their ability to process sparse, asynchronous events. We propose an innovative **spike-triggered adaptive threshold** mechanism that facilitates stable and effective training. Building on this foundation, we design a specialized **spiking feature pyramid network (SpikeFPN)** optimized for automotive event-based object detection. Comprehensive evaluations indicate that SpikeFPN achieves competitive performance compared to traditional SNNs and advanced artificial neural network (ANN) models while maintaining efficient computation.
